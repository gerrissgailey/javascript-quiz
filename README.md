# JavaScript Code Quiz

This project was designed to serve as a web app where coding students could take a timed quiz and test their knowledge of JavaScript.

This quiz app functions as follows:

- When the page is loaded, the user will have two options. One, to start the quiz. The second, to view previous high scores. 

- When the user presses the "Start" button, a series of multiple choice questions loads and the quiz timer starts it's countdown. 

- A selection of any of the answer buttons will advance to the next question. A selection of a correct answer will add 10 points to the score.

- The user is given 60 seconds to answer a series of five questions related to JavaScript. If the timer reaches zero before the user answers all of the questions, the quiz will end and display a screen where the user can enter their initials to record their score. 

- If the user answers all the quesitons, completing the quiz, then also will the quiz end and display the screen for the user to enter their initials and record their score.

- After submitting the users initials, the High Scores page will be displayed showing all stored users and scores. Local storage is used to store the history of the submitted high scores.

- From the High Scores page, the user can select to either go back to the start page, or to reset the high scores.
